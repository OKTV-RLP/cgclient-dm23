Client for Ropeskipping DM March 2023

## Settings and CSV Store

App-Settings and CSV-Files should be stored under `%APPDATA%\[ApplicationName]` on windows. A sample `settings.config` can be found in project root. CSV Files to be imported should be encoded in UTF-8.

## Todo

- [x] Clear all Layers Button
- [x] Make CSV-Name changable (through setting) => testing
- [x] Make CG-Channel changable (through setting) => testing
- [x] Update CSV button (where to put it?)

## Nice to have

- [ ] Display CG-Server-Version in Utils-Page
- [ ] Display CSV-Location in Utils-Page
- [x] App-Icon
